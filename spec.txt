Hi! I'm the owner of a large Canadian snow removal company. We cater to almost all cities in Canada.
We've done it for the past 10 years and our business keeps on growing.
we'd like to keep a very clear record of all our clients' information. 

Records should include their first and last names, address and date they started using our service.
It should also include a description of the type of area they would like snow to be removed from,
and the measurements in metres of that specific area as well.
Please note that we only accept clients who have at least 15 metres ² of land to clear.

Our clients have 3 options of how often they could use our service:
1) elite - every time it snows
2) standard - once a week
3) occasional - bi weekly
this should also be specified.

Reports:
1)we'd like to send out special offers to our best clients.
Only clients who used our service for 5 years or more OR clients who use our elite service should be listed and have a star next to their full name (ex:John Smith*)
2)How many clients are there per our three categories (elite, standard, occasional)?
3)How many years have each of our clients used our service for?
4)we'd like to see how much a client pays us per month.
We charge $3.00 per m² every time we come.
This column should always be shown.

Question: Do you ever have clients who stop using your service? 
if yes, do you want to keep a record of it?
Answer: Yes, occasionly clients do stop using our service due to various reasons and it is certainly important to store this information.
Question:Do you also need the time when they started using your service?
Answer: No, date is enough!
Question: What do you want us to include in their address?
Answer: As we cater to many cities a clear address is necessary. Address should include address number, street name, city, province and zipcode.
Question: You mentioned that you cater to almost all cities in Canada, which cities do you exclude?
Answer: It doesn't pay for us to do the cities in Canada's three territories: Northwest Territories, the Yukon and Nunavut. 
Question: What's the average amount of days a month you have to remove the snow for a client that uses the elite service?
Answer:10 times a month
Question: What's the highest amount you would eveer charge a client?
Answer: Clients who use our elite option obviously pay the most. As we only have equipment for lots that go upto 500m²
our price can't exceede more than $20,000.00 a month.
